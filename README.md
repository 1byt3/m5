## m5: the MQTT 5 Low Level Packet Library

### What is MQTT?

From the [MQTT version 5 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/):

*MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol.
It is light weight, open, simple, and designed to be easy to implement.
These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including
constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine
(M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint
is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.*
